- OTA updates
- marble.track (mDNS)
- make configurable at runtime without build
  - change pins
  - (add device)
  - save config on fs
- also support acceleration for stepper stop
- complete wheel cpp
- use zod to validate state
- Use Async API for describing WS possibilities
- if stepper finished, wheel is not updated, I would remove children state and let parent collect relevant state
